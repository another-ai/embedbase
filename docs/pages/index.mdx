Here is how to quickly use embedbase to hook your data to ChatGPT:

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```js copy {9}
import { createClient } from 'embedbase-js'
const embedbase = createClient('https://api.embedbase.xyz', '<grab me here https://app.embedbase.xyz/>')
const ads = [
    'Discover Harem Pants! Unique, stylish bohemian vibes with a dropped crotch & loose legs. Comfy meets chic - elevate your wardrobe. Limited stock - shop now!.',

]
const datasetId = 'product-ads'
const data = await embedbase.dataset(datasetId).batchAdd(ads.map((data) => ({ data })))
console.log(data)
```
```json
[
  {
    id: '9ced909f95e08e71a08bf6729be33dedc6793258c011989d5da9dd67b257509e',

  </Tab>
    <Tab>
```python copy {12}
from embedbase_client.client import EmbedbaseClient

embedbase = EmbedbaseClient('https://api.embedbase.xyz', '<grab me here https://app.embedbase.xyz/>')

ads = [
    'Discover Harem Pants! Unique, stylish bohemian vibes with a dropped crotch & loose legs. Comfy meets chic - elevate your wardrobe. Limited stock - shop now!.',

dataset_id = 'product-ads'
data = embedbase.dataset(dataset_id).batch_add([{'data': ad} for ad in ads])
print(data)
```
```json
[
  {
    id: '9ced909f95e08e71a08bf6729be33dedc6793258c011989d5da9dd67b257509e',

Now that you have your data in Embedbase, you can ask ask questions to ChatGPT
about your data:

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy {3}
const question = 'im looking for a nice pant that is comfortable and i can both use for work and for climbing'
const context = await embedbase.dataset(datasetId).createContext(question)
const prompt = 
    `Based on the following context:\n${context}\nAnswer the user's question: ${question}`
for await (const res of embedbase.generate(prompt)) {
    console.log(res)
}
```
```
You might want to try our Harem Pants! They have a dropped crotch and loose legs for comfort,
and their unique bohemian style can elevate your wardrobe for work.
However, please note that they may not be the most suitable for climbing.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```python copy {4}
import os
import openai
question = 'im looking for a nice pant that is comfortable and i can both use for work and for climbing'
context = embedbase.dataset(dataset_id).create_context(question)
prompt = f'Based on the following context:\n{context}\nAnswer the user\'s question: {question}'

openai.api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```
```

```

`.generate` is not yet available in the Python SDK, if you need it, [please reach out](https://discord.gg/3qXwZQ6Z)
we are moving fast and can implement this in a few hours.

You have to use OpenAI SDK in the meantime.
